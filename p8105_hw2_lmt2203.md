## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_xlsx("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
            sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
            range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate(
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read precipitation data

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2018 Precipitation",
             skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel("./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
             sheet = "2017 Precipitation",
             skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Now combine annual precipitation.

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble(
    month = 1:12,
    month_name = month.name
  )
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2018, precip_2017) 

left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

    ## # A tibble: 24 x 4
    ##     year month total month_name
    ##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>     
    ##  1  2018     1  0.94 January   
    ##  2  2018     2  4.8  February  
    ##  3  2018     3  2.69 March     
    ##  4  2018     4  4.69 April     
    ##  5  2018     5  9.27 May       
    ##  6  2018     6  4.77 June      
    ##  7  2018     7 10.2  July      
    ##  8  2018     8  6.45 August    
    ##  9  2018     9 10.5  September 
    ## 10  2018    10  2.12 October   
    ## # … with 14 more rows

This dataset contains information from the Mr.Trashwheel trash collector
in Baltimore, Maryland. As trash enters the inner harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash, and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month, and trash collected, include some specific
kinds of trash. There are a total of 344 rows in our final dataset.
Additional data sheets include month precpitation data.

## Problem 2

Read and clean the data

``` r
nyc_transit = read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, route1:route11, entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = recode(entry, "YES" = TRUE, "NO" = FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route8:route11), as.character)
```

This dataset contains *line, station\_name, station\_latitude,
station\_longitude, route1, route2, route3, route4, route5, route6,
route7, route8, route9, route10, route11, entry, vending,
entrance\_type, ada* variables. The dataset has dimensions of **1868**
rows and **19** columns. I imported the dataset, changed the variable
names to snake cases, select the variables of interest and converted the
entry variable from character to logical variable. This data is not yet
tidy because route name is spread across multiple columns.

  - To answer questions about the NYC transit data:
      - There are **465** distinct stations.
      - The number of stations that are ADA complaint is **84**.
      - The proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
        entrance is **37.704918**

Now reformat data so that route number and route names are distinct
variables

``` r
nyc_transit_long = nyc_transit %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11,
               names_to = "route_name",
               names_prefix = "route",
               values_to = "route_number")
```

  - To answer questions about the A train:
      - The number of distinct stations serve the A train is **60**.
      - Of the stations that serve the A train, there are **17**
        stations that are ADA complaint.

## Problem 3

Import and clean the three datasets

``` r
pols_df = read_csv("./data/pols-month.csv") %>% 
  separate(mon, into = c("year", "month", "day"), sep = "-" ) %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month),
         month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  mutate(president = case_when(prez_dem == 1 ~ "dem",
                               prez_gop == 1 ~ "gop")) %>% 
  select(-day, -prez_gop, -prez_dem) %>% 
  arrange(year)

snp_df = read_csv("./data/snp.csv") %>% 
  separate(date, into = c("month", "day", "year"), sep = "/") %>% 
  mutate(month = as.integer(month),
         month = month.abb[month]) %>% 
  select(-day) %>% 
  relocate(year) %>% 
  arrange(year)

unemployment_df = read_csv("./data/unemployment.csv") %>% 
  rename("year" = "Year") %>% 
  pivot_longer(Jan:Dec, 
               names_to = "month",
               values_to = "percentage_unemployment") %>% 
  arrange(year) %>% 
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

Joining the datasets

``` r
pols_snp = left_join(pols_df,snp_df )

pols_snp_unemployment = left_join(pols_snp, unemployment_df)
```

The “pols\_month” dataset contains **822** observations and contains
information on the number of politicians who are democratic or
republican at any given time. The year range from 1947, 2015. The “snp”
dataset contains **787** observations and contains the closing values of
the S\&P stock index on a given date. The year range from 1950, 2015.
The “unemployment” dataset contains **816** observations and has
percentage of unemployment of the associated time. The year range from
1948, 2015. The combined dataset has a total of **822** observations of
**11** variables.
